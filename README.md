# PROJECT EULER SOLUTIONS

My solutions for problems in [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/). These are just to help me get familiar with Python syntax as I am learning it.   

All of them pass the test on the website but there is no guarantee about the correctness as well as the performance of them since they are my own work in my free time.    

Each solution has `no_math_solution` function which is an implementation of my straightforward thought when I first read the question. Some has `math_solution` function whose purpose is to reduce the running time of the counterpart.
